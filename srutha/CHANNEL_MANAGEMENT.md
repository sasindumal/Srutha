# Channel Management Features

## ‚úÖ Delete Channel Functionality

The app now supports multiple ways to remove channels from your subscription list.

### üéØ Features Implemented

#### 1. **Delete Button** üóëÔ∏è
- Each channel card displays a delete icon button (trash icon)
- Located in the top-right corner of each channel card
- One tap to trigger deletion confirmation
- Visual feedback with red color (#ef4444)

#### 2. **Swipe to Delete** üëÜ
- Swipe left on any channel card to reveal delete action
- Smooth animation with gesture handler
- Red background with "Delete" text and icon
- Swipeable automatically closes on cancel

#### 3. **Confirmation Dialog** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Alert dialog before deleting to prevent accidental removal
- Shows channel name in confirmation message
- Warns that all videos will also be removed
- Options: "Cancel" or "Delete"
- Cancel option closes the swipeable if triggered by swipe

### üì± User Experience

#### Delete via Button
```
1. Navigate to Channels screen
2. Find the channel you want to remove
3. Tap the trash icon in the top-right corner
4. Confirm deletion in the alert dialog
5. Channel and all its videos are removed
```

#### Delete via Swipe
```
1. Navigate to Channels screen
2. Swipe left on any channel card
3. Red "Delete" action appears on the right
4. Tap the Delete button
5. Confirm deletion in the alert dialog
6. Channel and all its videos are removed
```

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Database Operations
- `deleteChannel(id)` removes channel from database
- Cascade delete removes all associated videos
- Uses SQLite foreign key constraints
- Transaction-safe operation

#### UI Components
**ChannelCard** (`src/components/ChannelCard.tsx`)
- Added `onDelete` prop for delete callback
- Delete button with IconButton component
- Styled with Material Design icons
- Stop propagation to prevent card tap

**ChannelsScreen** (`src/screens/ChannelsScreen.tsx`)
- Swipeable component from react-native-gesture-handler
- Right swipe action with animated background
- Ref management for swipeable components
- Confirmation Alert dialog

#### Context Management
**ChannelContext** (`src/context/ChannelContext.tsx`)
- `deleteChannel(channelId)` method
- Reloads channels and videos after deletion
- Error handling with user feedback
- Async/await pattern for database operations

### üé® Design Details

#### Delete Button
```tsx
<IconButton
  icon="delete-outline"
  size={20}
  iconColor="#ef4444"
  onPress={handleDelete}
/>
```

#### Swipe Action
```tsx
<Swipeable
  renderRightActions={(progress, dragX) => renderRightActions(...)}
  overshootRight={false}
  rightThreshold={40}
>
  <ChannelCard ... />
</Swipeable>
```

#### Colors
- Delete button icon: `#ef4444` (red-500)
- Swipe action background: `#ef4444` (red-500)
- Delete text: `#ffffff` (white)

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Required**
   - No accidental deletions
   - Clear warning about video removal
   - User must explicitly confirm

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Cascade delete ensures no orphaned videos
   - Foreign key constraints enforced
   - Transaction-based operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks around delete operations
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Graceful failure recovery

### üì¶ Dependencies

```json
{
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "~2.28.0",
  "react-native-paper": "^5.12.3",
  "react-native-vector-icons": "^10.0.3",
  "@types/react-native-vector-icons": "^6.4.18"
}
```

### üîÑ State Management

#### Before Delete
```typescript
channels: Channel[] // All subscribed channels
videos: Video[]     // All videos from all channels
```

#### After Delete
```typescript
// Channel removed from database
await databaseHelper.deleteChannel(channelId);

// Videos cascade deleted automatically
// Foreign key constraint: ON DELETE CASCADE

// State refreshed
await loadChannels(); // Reload channel list
await loadVideos();   // Reload video list
```

### üêõ Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty Channel List**
   - Shows empty state with icon and message
   - "Add a channel to get started" subtitle
   - No delete buttons shown

2. **Swipeable Cleanup**
   - Refs properly managed in Map
   - Auto-close on cancel
   - Cleanup on delete

3. **Network Independent**
   - All operations work offline
   - Only local database affected
   - No API calls required for deletion

### üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Undo delete with Snackbar
- [ ] Bulk delete multiple channels
- [ ] Archive instead of permanent delete
- [ ] Export channel list before delete
- [ ] Confirmation with channel statistics

### üìù Code Examples

#### Delete Handler
```typescript
const handleDeleteChannel = (channelId: string, channelName: string) => {
  Alert.alert(
    'Delete Channel',
    `Are you sure you want to delete "${channelName}"? This will also remove all its videos.`,
    [
      {
        text: 'Cancel',
        style: 'cancel',
        onPress: () => {
          swipeableRefs.current.get(channelId)?.close();
        },
      },
      {
        text: 'Delete',
        style: 'destructive',
        onPress: async () => {
          await deleteChannel(channelId);
          swipeableRefs.current.delete(channelId);
        },
      },
    ]
  );
};
```

#### Database Delete
```typescript
async deleteChannel(id: string): Promise<void> {
  if (!this.db) throw new Error('Database not initialized');

  // Delete videos first
  await this.db.runAsync('DELETE FROM videos WHERE channelId = ?', id);
  
  // Then delete channel
  await this.db.runAsync('DELETE FROM channels WHERE id = ?', id);
}
```
